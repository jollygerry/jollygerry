- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jollygerry
- I work as a pharmacist for Walgreens
- Iâ€™m interested in pharmacy, healthcare, data analytics, and web development
- I have experience in web development working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I am making a transition to data analytics
- Iâ€™m currently learning R and SQL as part of the Google Data Analytics Career Certificate
- If you would like to collaborate or discuss issues in healthcare that can be solved with the power of programming, I can be reached at cal19@ymail.com!
